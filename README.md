    <p>This is the <strong>first "serious" project</strong> I have done. It basically is a simple calculator made with <code>Tkinter</code> that can perform sum, substraction, multiplication and division. <strong>It doesn't allow parenthesis</strong>, so in order to get multiple operations right, you first have to hit the "Equals" (=) button before trying to perform any other operation.</p>

    <h2>How it works üîß</h2>

    <p>In this section I will show you how this simple calculator program works:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Use <code>git clone</code> to clone the repository and execute the <code>Calculator.py</code> file (or just download this sigle file, it's the only one needed). After that, you will have something like this: <br><br>
        <img src="images/Calculator_GUI.png" alt="Calculator GUI" style="display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 350px;">
        <br><br>
        </li>
        <li>Introduce a number and after that, press any operation symbol. Pressing an operations symbol should store the number in the <code>result</code> variable and reset the screen value to 0.
        <br><br>
        </li>
        <li>Now you have 2 options:<br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>Introduce a new value and press "Equals" (=) button. This should give the desired result
                <br><br>
                </li>
                <li>Introduce a new value and press the same operational symbol as before to concatenate (e.g. the sum) as many times as you want, and then press the "Equals" (=) button. Before switching between operations, <strong>always</strong> hit the "Equals" (=) button<br><br></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>And that's all, you should be able to work perfectly with this calculator to perform easy math üòâ.<br><br></li>
    </ol>
